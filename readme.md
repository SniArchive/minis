# Mini'S
> MiniSnips is home to all of my mini projects and sites. Most of these projects are made to improve my programming knowledge. ðŸŒ±
> The website is hosted on GitHub pages right from the repository. I have added all of my projects to the root directory and their info in `data.js` file. The script just iterate the items in `data.js` and display them as a seperate card. Made with Tailwind CSS.
